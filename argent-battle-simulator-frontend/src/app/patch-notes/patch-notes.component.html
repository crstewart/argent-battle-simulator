                <h3>Reign of Shadows</h3>
                Villains, bad guys, anti-heroes. Whatever label you give them, they've arrived en masse onto the
                battlefield. Our battle-tested heroes will have their hands full with these new enemies. Of course,
                some of these villains will meet resistance from familiar foes of their own. But that's not all! Some
                new heroes are rising from the shadows themselves and sneaking their way into the fray as well!

                <strong>New Mechanic: Stealth</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stealth attacks act as an attack and a dodge rolled up into one move. The hit chance for the
                    enemy's attack is reduced, boosted by the attacker's speed, agility, and small size. In addition
                    to the increased dodge chance, the attack cannot be guarded or dodged. However, these attacks are
                    usually weak in power.</li>
                    <li>The increased dodge chance on a stealth attack can be negated by a character that has the new
                    trait <strong>Stealth Detection</strong>.</li>
